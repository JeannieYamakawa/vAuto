#Welcome to Jeannie's code challenge!
* I built this as a simple AngularJS app for proof-of-concept of my frontend skills, because I was told I may start with more web dev related tasks and transition into more C#.
* Instead of using only built-in AngularJS filters or directives on the HTML side, I created word groups on the prototype itself to feed to the frontend for the purpose of exporting entirely reusable arrangements, because this type of logic would probably be used on the backend too. This means tables with 4 columns can now be populated on any frontend framework/design or html structure of choice. 
* Tables with any number of columns can now also be recreated here simply by changing the % number.
* My app should run in O(n) time, as I tried to take into account runtime and complexity.
* I did use JavaScript's built-in .sort() method, which typically runs Quick Sort in Chrome, unless an array contains fewer than 10 items. Another sorting algorithm can be easily used, if necessary.
