#Welcome to Jeannie's code challenge!
Instead of using only built-in AngularJS filters on the HTML side, I created word groups on the prototype itself to feed to the frontend for the purpose of exporting entirely reusable arrangements, because this type of logic might be used on the backend. This means tables with 4 columns can now be populated on any frontend framework/design or html structure of choice OR tables with any number of columns can now also be recreated here simply by changing the % number.
